# Pet Adoption Center - React SPA

This is a **React Single Page Application (SPA)** for a **Pet Adoption Center**. The main goal of this application is to provide users with an easy way to **adopt a pet** they like and to **put up new pets for adoption**.

## **Key Features:**

- **Adopt a Pet**:  
  Users can browse available pets and request adoption.

- **Put up Pets for Adoption**:  
  Registered users can add new pets for adoption. They can upload pet details, such as name, breed, age, and upload photos to share with others. 

- **Edit and Delete Pets**:  
  Users have full control over pets they have added. They can modify the pet details or remove pets from the adoption listing.

- **User Profile Integration**:  
  Each pet added for adoption is associated with a user (the petâ€™s **"owner"**), allowing for better tracking and management of pet listings.

## **Technologies Used:**

- **Frontend**:
  - **React**: For building the user interface and creating a dynamic web application.
  - **Vite**: A fast build tool and development server used for bundling and speeding up the development process.
  - **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework used for responsive and modern design.

- **Backend**:  
  - **SoftUni's Practice Server**: Provides the backend API for handling user authentication, pet data storage, and CRUD operations on pets.

- **Routing**:  
  - **React Router**: Used for navigation between pages such as **Home**, **Pets Catalog**, **Pet Details**, **Register**, **Login**, etc.

- **State Management**:  
  - **React Context API**: Used to manage **user authentication state** and **pet data** across the app, ensuring data consistency across components.

## **Future Features:**

- **Adoption Requests**:  
  The **"Request Adoption"** button will be fully functional in future versions. Users will be able to officially request adoption for their chosen pet, and the request will be processed.

- **Pet Search**:  
  A search feature will allow users to filter pets by various criteria, such as **pet type**, **age**, **breed**, and other characteristics. This will make it easier for users to find the perfect pet.

- **Pet Reviews**:  
  In the future, users will be able to leave **reviews** and **ratings** for pets they have adopted, helping other potential adopters make informed decisions.

- **Pet Comments**:  
  Users will also be able to leave **comments** or feedback on listed pets, which can help further engage the pet adoption community.
